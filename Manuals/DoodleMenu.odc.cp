General properties        [top]

The commands in this menu provide various miscelaneous tools.


New...        [top]

			

Dialog box for creating a new Doodle. Allows a choice of size of the Doodle graphic and the size of the nodes in the Doodle.

			
No grid        [top]

No snap grid to which the centre of each node and each corner of each plate is constrained to lie.


grid 1mm        [top]

1mm snap grid to which the centre of each node and each corner of each plate is constrained to lie.


grid 2mm        [top]

2mm snap grid to which the centre of each node and each corner of each plate is constrained to lie.


grid 5mm        [top]

5mm snap grid to which the centre of each node and each corner of each plate is constrained to lie.


Scale Model        [top]



Shrinks the Doodle so that the size of each node and plate plus the separation between them is reduced by a constant factor. The Doodle will move towards the top left corner of the window. This command is useful if you run out of space while drawing the Doodle. Note that the Doodle will still be constrained by the snap grid, and if the snap is coarse then the Doodle could be badly distorted.


Remove selection        [top]

Removes the highlighting from the selected node or plate of the Doodle if any.
