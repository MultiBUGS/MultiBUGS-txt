This manual describes how to use the BUGS software. It starts with general sections on setting up statistical models in BUGS and using Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling for statistical inference. Then the idea of compound documents and the many menu options of the Windows interface to BUGS are described in detail.


The BUGS software is Open Source

Potential users are reminded to be extremely careful if using this program for serious statistical analysis. We have tested the program on quite a wide set of examples, but be particularly careful with types of model that are currently not featured. If there is a problem, BUGS might just crash, which is not very good, but it might well carry on and produce answers that are wrong, which is even worse. Please let us know of any successes or failures.

Beware: MCMC sampling can be dangerous!
