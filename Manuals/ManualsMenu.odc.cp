	Manuals Menu

This menu gives access to the various manuals describing the use of the BUGS software. The first group of options opens the contents pages of the manuals as hyper-text documents. Clicking on the blue links will open further windows displaying the contents of the manuals. The second group of options prints a copy of the manuals. If a physical printer is the default printer the result is a paper. If the default printer is set to a file you will get a Postscript or a PDF file. When printing the manual please make sure you do not have that manual open.
